    duration: 4,
    industry: 'Media',
    role: 'Lead/Senior Developer',
    tech: ['C#', '.NET Core', 'Azure', 'JavaScript', 'SQL Server'],
    teamSize: 10,
   description: [
      `As a senior developer, I contributed to modernizing a legacy self-service platform in the media industry. I implemented CI/CD pipelines and 
      helped establish domain-aligned architecture principles. My role included designing and implementing integration between the legacy database
      system and a modern third-party SaaS service platform, which enabled new capabilities while maintaining system stability.
      I created robust test harnesses that supported confident feature development in a complex environment where multiple
      applications shared a single database.`,

      `I set up automated CI/CD pipelines for the legacy application using Azure DevOps, helping transform
      the process from manual to automated deployments and enabling more frequent, smaller releases. I suggested practical
      improvements to team dynamics, such as establishing shared sprint goals and limiting work-in-progress
      within my areas of influence.`,

      `I participated in planning sessions with stakeholders to better align priorities before development began when
      possible. I provided technical guidance to team members, demonstrating clean code practices and domain-driven
      design principles through practical examples in my contributions.`,

      `I focused on deeply understanding the business domain to ensure my technical solutions aligned with real user
      needs and business objectives. I balanced addressing technical debt with new feature development in my
      work areas, ensuring continuous delivery of business value despite the challenges of a large-scale rewrite.
      This project demonstrates my commitment to creating sustainable value through quality engineering practices,
      even when working within constraints of broader project decisions.`,

      `I iteratively reimplemented old stored procedure logic as C# code by incrementally moving the SQL to the C# project
      and then refactoring it to EF Core queries and C# logic, all while maintaining the working system. The partial rewrite
      was secured with extensive blackbox and integration tests to ensure reliability and business continuity.`

      `Developed a product lifecycle management system that streamlined the entire process of product changes, 
      including Bill of Materials (BOM) management and structured review workflows. Created a Java/Spring backend 
      and web UI, while also developing a companion mobile client that enabled field technicians to document 
      investigations of damaged products with photos and evidence, significantly improving report quality.`,

      `Implemented a detailed investigation module for damaged or malfunctioning products, allowing engineers to document 
      findings and track resolution progress. The mobile client significantly improved the quality of field reports 
      by providing real-time data collection capabilities.`,

      `Designed an web UI for the main system that streamlined the review and approval workflows, making it easier 
      for stakeholders to collaborate on product changes. Integrated document management capabilities to ensure all product 
      specifications and change documentation were properly versioned and accessible.`,

      `Mentored junior developers on the project, providing guidance on best practices in software development, code reviews,

      and requirements gathering to final delivery. The system allowed customers to track orders in real-time and receive 
      status notifications through a responsive UI. As scrum master, implemented an approach where customers 
      directly tried the software in test environments during weekly demos, creating high trust and earning recognition 
      from the client.`,

      `Created a integration layer to pull data from the legacy internal order management system that previously 
      couldn't provide data to external users. Architected the solution to run entirely in Azure, leveraging cloud services 
      for scalability, reliability, and global accessibility.`,

      `Implemented a secure data synchronization mechanism that protected sensitive information while providing customers 
      with the details they needed. Advocated for and implemented DevOps practices, setting up continuous integration and 
      delivery pipelines that enabled frequent, reliable deployments.`,

      `Collaborated with UX designers to create an intuitive interface that received positive feedback from international users. 
      The weekly demo approach where customers directly tried the software in the test environment, instead of us presenting 
      finished features, created high trust between the client and the team and resulted in recognition for this

  "I believe that true value comes from deeply understanding the problems customers are trying to solve.",
