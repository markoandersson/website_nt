      <p class="text-secondary leading-relaxed">
        As a senior developer with over {yearsExperience} years of experience, I've learned to focus on what really matters: 
        understanding the business context, working closely with teams, and creating sustainable solutions. 
        I connect technology with business needs through clean code that speaks the language of the business domain. 
        This makes communication clearer between technical and non-technical people. 
        For me, Test-Driven Development is a practical tool for designing maintainable software that works as expected.
      </p>
      <p class="text-secondary leading-relaxed">
        My biggest lesson over the years is simple: the best solutions are usually the simplest ones. I deliver 
        value in small, frequent iterations with constant feedback, so we can adjust quickly to changing requirements 
        without creating unnecessary complexity. Since every problem exists in its own unique context, I don't believe 
        in one-size-fits-all approaches. Instead, I try different solutions and pick the one that works best for the specific situation.
